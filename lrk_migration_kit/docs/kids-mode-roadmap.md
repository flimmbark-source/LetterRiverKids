# Letter River Kids Build Roadmap

## Goal
Ship a standalone Letter River Kids app derived from letter-learning mode, optimized for pre-readers and early readers.

## Phase 1: Parity Extraction (1-2 days)
- [ ] Extract letter-learning mode plus dependencies
- [ ] Verify app boots with same learning loop
- [ ] Freeze baseline with screenshot/video

## Phase 2: Child-first UX (3-5 days)
- [ ] Bigger hit targets (minimum 56px)
- [ ] Simplified top nav (Home, Play, Parent)
- [ ] Reduce on-screen text; use icon and audio prompts
- [ ] Association mode as default (sound/visual pairing)
- [ ] Friendly retry loops without punitive feedback

## Phase 3: Motivation redesign (3-4 days)
- [ ] Replace text achievements with sticker/character unlocks
- [ ] Add immediate multimodal feedback (sound, visual, haptic where available)
- [ ] Add short session quests (3-5 minute goals)
- [ ] Add caregiver digest screen (progress without score anxiety)

## Phase 4: Accessibility and inclusion (2-4 days)
- [ ] Presets: motor, sensory, cognitive, auditory
- [ ] Adjustable pace, animation intensity, contrast, audio rate
- [ ] Optional no-timer mode
- [ ] Left-handed / right-handed UI option

## Phase 5: Learning science layer (3-5 days)
- [ ] Mastery states per letter: New -> Practicing -> Mastered
- [ ] Spaced repetition queue for fragile letters
- [ ] Confusion-pair detection (letters often mixed up)
- [ ] Adaptive review (more reps where needed)

## Phase 6: Parent mode and safety (2-3 days)
- [ ] Parent gate for settings
- [ ] Privacy-safe analytics events
- [ ] No external links from child surface
- [ ] Session timer and break prompts

## Metrics to track
- Completion rate per session
- Mean attempts to mastery by letter
- Retention D1/D7
- Help-trigger frequency
- Frustration proxies (rapid mis-taps, repeated exits)
